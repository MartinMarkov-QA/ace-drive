**HTML,** **CSS** and **JavaScript** for a client who is a driving instructor in UK.

## Motivation:
I wanted to build static site, hosted on github, so that my client can save some money and avoid paying for a hosting.<br>
At the same time he requested to have few forms on the site, who collect different data depending on the user needs.<br>
To avoid any backend logic for the site, I did a bit of a research and found this free service:<br>
https://formsubmit.co/<br> 
which basically handle all the site form submissions and sends the results to the client email address.

## Libraries used:
For the image slider I used **tiny-slider** library - https://github.com/ganlanyuan/tiny-slider <br>
For the site layout and the css I used **bootstrap 5** - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/ <br>

#ace-drive https://acedrivedt.co.uk/

This site is build with HTML, CSS and JavaScript for friend of mine who is driving instructor in UK.

Motivation:<br>
I wanted to build static site hosted on github, so that my friend doesn't pay for a hosting. At the same time he requested to have few forms on site, which collect different data depending on the user needs.<br>
For this purpose I have done a bit of research and found this service:<br>
https://formsubmit.co/ Which basically handle all the form submissions and sends the results to his email address. 

Libraries:<br>
For the image slider I used tiny-slider library - https://github.com/ganlanyuan/tiny-slider <br>
For the css I used bootstrap 5 - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/ <br>
